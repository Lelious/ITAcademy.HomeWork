My program emulates a truncated passage through the registration steps for flying on an airplane. 
You must go through 3 registration steps, such as: Passport check, Check In and Security check. 
You can go through Check In at the very beginning, as if simulating an early passage, or go through it later, 
along with the rest of the procedures. At the end of the registration phase, you can see what else is left to go through. 
At the end, when all 3 stages are completed, you will see a message about the successful completion of all stages, 
as well as a message that wishes a good path.
